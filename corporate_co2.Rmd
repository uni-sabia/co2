Who are the largest corporate CO2 emitters in South Korea? How are they affected by the Korean Emissions Trading System? In this blog post, I will analyze 2019 corporate carbon emissions data from South Korea's Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Research Center (http://www.gir.go.kr/home/index.do?menuId=37) in combination with the K-ETS CO2 permit allocation data provided by Newstapa (https://data.newstapa.org/datasets/%EC%98%A8%EC%8B%A4%EA%B0%80%EC%8A%A4-%EB%B0%B0%EC%B6%9C%EA%B6%8C-%ED%95%A0%EB%8B%B9%EB%9F%89), and macroeconomic data provided by the World Bank. After reading this article, you'll find out 

* Top 10 corporate carbon emitters' change in carbon emissions 2011-2016
* Comparison between their actual carbon emissions and allocation of CO2 certificates (permits)


# What is K-ETS? 

In 2015, South Korea adopted Emissions Trading System (K-ETS) in order to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 24.4% below the 2017 level. It is a cap-and-trade system that puts a cap on carbon emissions on 685 companies by distributing CO2 allowances (permits) based on individual company's emissions history. That is, if a company is carbon-intensive, it would receive more CO2 permits than those that are less carbon-intensive. If a company emits more CO2 than the allocated amount, it would have to purchase permits from other companies, which cost about $27.62 per tonne of CO2 equivalent in 2020. For more information on K-ETS system, check out the latest report from the [International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP)](https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/?option=com_etsmap&task=export&format=pdf&layout=list&systems%5B%5D=47).

K-ETS system has received much criticism for being too generous with the free allocation of allowances. The companies that are obliged to participate in the cap-and-trade market received the allowances for free. [Newstapa](https://newstapa.org/article/eRQBR), an independent journalism agency in South Korea, recently revealed that the carbon-intensive companies received more allowances than their actual emissions. This gave the companies no incentive to reduce carbon emissions. In fact, they even made extra profit by selling the carbon allowances! 

Newstapa's investigation result was a shock for me. I couldn't believe that a system that was designed to stimulate corporate climate action could be failing that hard. So I decided to dig into the data that were used for the investigation. 

# Data 

[South Korea's Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Research Center](http://www.gir.go.kr/home/index.do?menuId=37) publishes corporate carbon emissions data annually. We will analyze data from 2014 (one year before K-ETS was introduced) until 2019. Newstapa has made the CO2 permit allocation data publicly available on their [Data Portal](https://data.newstapa.org/datasets/%EC%98%A8%EC%8B%A4%EA%B0%80%EC%8A%A4-%EB%B0%B0%EC%B6%9C%EA%B6%8C-%ED%95%A0%EB%8B%B9%EB%9F%89). Both datasets are in Korean. 

I merged the datasets by company name using the VLOOKUP function on Google Sheet. I used Google Sheet because I can use the GOOGLETRANSLATE function to automatically translate the excel file. If you ever need to translate a spreadsheet, I highly recommend using this function!

# Data Cleaning

The resulting dataset contains names of companies subjected to carbon pricing, their sectors, annual carbon emissions and allowances that they received for free from 2015 until 2019. 

```{r}
co2_raw <- read.csv("data/kr_corporate_co2.csv")
co2 <- co2_raw %>% select(-sector_kor) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(emissions_t, energy_consumption_tj), as.numeric) # Sort by 2019 emissions in descending order
co2_2019 <- co2 %>% filter(year==2019) %>% arrange(desc(emissions_t))
head(co2_2019, 10) %>% kbl(caption="Top 10 carbon-intensive South Korean companies in 2019") %>%
  kable_classic()
```

```{r}

```
