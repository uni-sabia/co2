# Analyzing the difference in the rate of CO2 emissions reduction between transport and energy sector.

In UK and the US, carbon emissions reduction is making larger progress in the electricity sector than the transport sector (See (this blog post from Energy Institute at Hass)[https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2021/01/11/a-tale-of-two-sectors/]). Is this true for other major economies? 

# Research questions

* How much progress has the world made in carbon emission reduction? 
* Which sector has highest co2 emission? 
* Which sector is making the fastest progress on emissions reduction?
* How does Europe's carbon emission reduction in the electricity sector compare to the transport sector?
